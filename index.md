VikiLinkBot (often abbreviated to “vlb”) is a bot, i.e. a program that provides
[Vikidia](https://www.vikidia.org)-related information to its users:

-   **interactively**: it can answer specific [queries](shell) from [users](user);
-   **spontaneously**: it can provide new data as soon at it is available, or periodically.

Other interesting things:

-   vlb's output format is [regular and specified](yfi).
-   vlb uses [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) for its [persistent storage](persistence).
-   vlb uses [YAML](http://yaml.org) for its [configuration file](config).

**Warning:** This documentation only covers the upcoming but not-yet-released
**version 3**!
